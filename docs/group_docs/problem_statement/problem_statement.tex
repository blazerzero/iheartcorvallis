		This document details the "I Heart Corvallis" mobile application, which will be used to get students and other 
		community members more involved in various events, meetings, and projects. In many cases, students choose 
		not to get involved in community activities because they do not feel connected to the Corvallis community. "I Heart 
		Corvallis" will aim to solve that problem by giving students and community members an incentive to get involved by 
		rewarding them for how much they contribute to the community. The final product should consist of an application 
		available for both Android and iOS that lists the various community events, projects, and meetings being put on by 
		different organizations, authenticates the user, successfully tracks the events they engage in, and provides rewards 
		for completing enough community activities.

	\section{The Problem}
		A current problem that the Corvallis Community Relations office is facing is that college students are not getting 
		involved with the Corvallis community. There may be several reasons for this problem. One reason could be that 
		students are not interested enough to get involved in activities around the community, or they might not think the 
		events are worth attending. Students often do not feel a sense of belonging or responsibility to our community, and 
		this is largely because students are only here for a short period of time, so they mostly identify with being a part of the 
		OSU community rather than the Corvallis community as a whole. Another reason could be that they are not aware of 
		opportunities available to them. These activities may not be advertised well enough for students to easily find them.
	
	\section{The Solution}
		We plan to tackle this problem by creating the "I Heart Corvallis" mobile app. I Heart Corvallis is inspired by the Bend 
		Visitor and Convention Bureau's app "Bend Ale Trail," which gives users a virtual "passport" containing various 
		breweries in Bend. Users of the Bend Ale Trail app get a stamp for every brewery they visit and win prizes for going to 
		enough breweries. The app also provides a map of the breweries, as well as tour information, lodging and taxi 
		information, and information about other events going on in town. \\ \\
		I Heart Corvallis will be available for both Android and iOS and aims to 
		inform members of the Corvallis community, both students and others, about various initiatives and resources around 
		the community, as well as get community members more involved with community projects, events, and meetings by 
		giving them an incentive to do so. \\ \\			
		The application will essentially be a passport for students. They will receive stamps for helping out with service 
		projects, attending city council meetings, attending workshops, and attending other community activities, and will be 
		rewarded for accumulating enough stamps. The rewards will work in tiers; as you gain more stamps, you become 
		eligible for better rewards. \\ \\			
		To help students be more aware of community events, the application will also utilize the Google Maps API to show 
		where events and various community resources can be found. The app will also include a separate page that will 
		provide additional information about the city of Corvallis, such as links to website in the community and information 
		about our office and the initiative. \\ \\			
		Functionally, the app will display the user's "passport" (the events they have attended and any stamps they have 
		collected). Whenever the user attends an event, they will earn a stamp. Depending on which event the user attends 
		and completes, the number of stamps awarded to them will vary. For example, volunteering at a blood drive or big 
		community event will give you more stamps than walking up Bald Hill. Once the user accumulates enough stamps, 
		they will win a reward. In order to claim a reward the user will have to visit the Corvallis Community Relations office 
		and show our clients the stamps they have collected. \\ \\			
		Users will be required to either log in or create an account to use the app. Their passport will be saved to their account 
		so that if they log out, their progress is not lost. OSU students will log in with their ONID username and password, and 
		other users will need to create a username and password.\\ \\			
		In order to confirm that the user actually attended this activity, there will be a code specific to each event that will be 
		distributed by the host at the end of the event, and the users will input the code to acquire that stamp. For location-
		based events, such as walking up Bald Hill, there will be a flyer or sign put up at the location that will specify for users 
		of the I Heart Corvallis application to check-in on their phones to acquire the stamp. \\ \\			
		Only the Corvallis Community Relations office will be able to add and edit events in the passport, as they will review 
		and approve every event prior to adding it to the app. If someone has an event they would like to add to the app, they 
		must go to the Corvallis Community Relations office to get approval, and even then, the Corvallis Community 
		Relations office maintains sole authority to add the event to the app.
	
	\section{Performance Metrics}
		Upon completion of the project, the above features will be fully implemented into the application, students will be able 
		to view their passport, earn stamps, and view the community resources available to them without the app crashing. 
		The stamp system will successfully add the appropriate stamps into each user's passport, and the Corvallis 
		Community Relations office will have the ability to add and remove events into the database without crashes or 
		overflows. \\ \\
		The application will also be designed for longevity. The Corvallis Community Relations office does not have much 
		technical prowess available to them. Therefore, we need to ensure that this app will continue to allow users to view 
		their passport, successfully earn stamps for attending events, and view resources available to them in the community 
		after our departure. We will also need to ensure that the app will allow non-technical clients, like the Corvallis 
		Community Relations office, to add and edit events, as well as navigate the back end of the app.
