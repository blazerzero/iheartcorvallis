How to run the Application:
1. Download Android Studio (if you haven't already)
2. Open Android Studio
3. Choose "Open an existing Android Studio project"
4. Navigate to the "IHCv2" directory, then click "Open"
5. Click the "Build" button (the green hammer icon)
6. Once the app is done building, click the "Run" button (the green play icon)
7. Choose if you want to run the app on your connected Android device or on the emulator

Things that need to be modified once the database tables, webpages, and app scripts get moved:
1. Each Loader class has a URL variable, and everything in the URL before the name of the PHP file needs to be changed to the new file path
2. In every webpage script and app script that connects to the database, the values for each connection variable need to be changed to the new values
